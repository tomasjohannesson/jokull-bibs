  abstract = {The year 2009 marked the centennial of earthquake monitoring in Iceland. This year was also the 30th anniversary of volumetric strain measurements in boreholes, the 20th anniversary of the initiation of the SIL seismic network and the 10th anniversary of the ISGPS continuous GPS station network. To mark these milestones, the Meteorological Office, in collaboration with the University of Iceland, University of Akureyri, Reykjavík University, Iceland Geosurvey and the University of Uppsala hosted an international conference on earthquakes, pre-earthquake processes and earthquake prediction research on October 30th. The conference was dedicated to the memory of Sigurður Thorlacius Rögnvaldsson, geophysicist, who died in a tragic car accident in October 1999. A total of 15 talks and 17 posters were presented at the conference.
Following the conference, participants were invited to submit papers to a special issue of Jökull. The first seven papers of this issue were presented at the meeting. The articles span a wide range of topics on fault mapping, seismicity studies, studies of seismic noise and GPS measurements. It is in many ways suitable that such a wide range of topics be represented in this specialissue commemorating Sigurður Rögnvaldsson as his work during his short career was quite broad in scope. Also, in earthquake prediction research a multi-disciplinary approach is needed.},

  abstract = {Iceland is a natural laboratory for a variety of processes associated with crustal deformation, such as earthquakes, magmatic events, tectonic plate motions, and glacial load changes. Continuous GPS (CGPS) measurements started in Iceland in 1995, and since then data from the network have helped to shed light on many different active deformation processes. The number of CGPS sites in Iceland tripled during 2006–2008, as a result of an international collaborative effort coordinated by Icelandic scientists. By early 2010 the number of CGPS stations in Iceland had reached 64, located primarily around and within the North-American–Eurasian plate boundary zone. Since its initiation, the CGPS network has played an important role in monitoring volcanoes and seismogenic areas, most notably during the 2009–2010 Eyjafjallajökull volcano unrest. Plate spreading of up to 2 cm per year usually dominates the horizontal motion observed at the CGPS sites, while uplift is observed at many of the stations due to recent retreat of the Icelandic ice caps. Co-seismic and post-seismic deformation of the largest earthquakes in 2000 and 2008 in the South Iceland Seismic Zone were captured by the network, and high-rate (1 Hz) CGPS observations helped to identify two magnitude 6 mainshocks in 2008 that were separated in time by only 2–3 seconds. The CGPS network has thus enabled us to monitor deformation occurring over days to months caused by migration of magma or fluids, post-seismic transients, rapid deformation caused by earthquakes and eruptions, as well as the long term plate spreading signal.},

  abstract = {On May 29th 2008, two $M_w$ ∼6 earthquakes struck the western part of the South Iceland Seismic Zone. The first event was followed within seconds by a similar size event on a second fault ∼5 km further west. Earthquakes, detected by a temporary network of 11 seismometers and three permanent SIL-network stations were located using an automated Coalescence Microseismic Mapping technique. The epicenters delineate two major and several smaller N–S faults as well as an E–W zone of activity stretching further west into the Reykjanes Peninsula Rift Zone. Fault plane solutions show right lateral strike slip mechanisms along the two major N–S faults and suggest both smaller N–S right-lateral strike slip faults further west as well as an E–W zone of left lateral strike slip fault. The aftershocks deepen from 3–5 km in the north to 8–9 km in the south, suggesting that the main faults dip southwards. A brief increase in aftershock seismicity is most likely caused by short-term static stress buildup on adjacent faults. The faulting is interpreted to be driven by the local stress due to transform motion between two parallel segments of the divergent plate boundary crossing Iceland.},

  abstract = {Factors such as network geometry, network size and phase-picking accuracy have significant effects on the precision of seismic hypocentre locations. In turn, the precision of the hypocentral locations dictates the degree to which morphological details within seismic swarms may be resolved. The Icelandic national seismic network (SIL) is designed to monitor seismic activity across large expanses of Iceland in real-time using automated earthquake detection and location software. Here we examine the performance of the SIL network relative to a much denser, local network of seismometers deployed around the Askja volcano in the Northern Volcanic Zone. A subset of earthquakes from the 2007–2008 dyke intrusion beneath Mt. Upptyppingar is used to compare single- and multi-event hypocentral locations. Specifically, we highlight 288, high signal-to-noise ratio events that occurred during an intensive sequence of earthquakes from 6–24 July 2007, when the temporary Askja network was active. A careful refinement of phase onsets recorded by our well-configured, dense network of receivers reveals hypocentres clustered tightly on a planar structure, interpreted as a dyke dipping at 49°. The root-mean-square (RMS) misfit to the plane (114 m) is only slightly greater than the uncertainties in relative locations of the earthquakes themselves, and constitutes a three-fold reduction in RMS misfit over SIL relative locations. The improved precision, facilitated predominantly by a more favourable network size and configuration, permits a more detailed analysis of the intrusion.},

  abstract = {West Bohemia (Czech Republic) and Vogtland (Germany) are among the most active intraplate earthquake-swarm areas in Europe with the largest events mostly of magnitudes $M_L$ < 4.0. The principal char-acteristics of the West Bohemia/Vogtland earthquake swarms are derived on the basis of local observations from the network WEBNET during the period between 1991 and 2009.  Swarm microearthquakes clustered in number of small focal areas; however, about 90\% of the total seismic moment was released in the Nový Kostel (NK) focal zone, which was formed by an NNW striking and steeply dipping fault plane. The focal depths ranged between 5 and 22 km in the whole region and between 4.5 and 11 km in the NK zone, while most of the swarm events clustered at depths from 8.5 to 9.5 km. All larger earthquake swarms took place in the NK zone; though they were located close, they differed significantly in their evolution. Two swarms, the 2000 ($M_L$ ≤ 3.3) and 2008 ($M_L$ ≤ 3.8) swarms were located on the same portion of the NK focal zone which implies reactivation of the same fault segment. Attention was paid to source mechanisms of the 1997 and 2000 swarms, particularly to the non-shear components in the 1997-swarm earthquakes.  All the 1997 sources were of dipole character: the slightly compressive dipoles dominating in the first swarm phase were replaced by tensile dipoles in the second phase. On the contrary, the 2000 swarm events possessed pure double-couple sources which resulted in pure shears along the NK fault. We infer that the pure-shear rupturing in the 2000 swarm was on account of the favourably oriented NK fault plane with respect to the local tectonic stress field whereas the additional tensile forces were needed for rupturing due to the unfavourably oriented 1997-swarm fault segments.  Further, we analyzed statistic characteristics and we show that the magnitude-frequency distribution with the b-value ≈ 1.0 is typical for the West Bohemia/Vogtland earthquake swarms and that scalar moments $M_0$ and the WEBNET magnitudes $M_L$ are related according to power-law $M_0$ ∝ 10$^{M_L}$, which is inconsistent with the definition of the moment magnitude $M_0$ ∝ 10$^{1.5 M_w}$ given by Kanamori (1977). We also show that this inconsistency results in a discrepancy in b-value of the magnitude-frequency distribution. Taking into account total seismic moment of the 2000 and 2008 swarms we infer that $M_{L_{MAX}}$ ∼ 5.0 to 5.3 is the maximum expected magnitude in the main NK focal zone and thus in the whole region. There is still an open question concerning the internal and external triggering of the West Bohemia/Vogtland earthquake swarms. We refer to the results of our recent study and infer that the earthquake swarm probably represents gradually propagating rupture along the fault and that both static and dynamic Coulomb stress changes along the fault plane due to co-seismic slip contribute significantly to triggering of the swarm events. Repeatedly observed almost simultaneous occurrence of seismic activity in different focal zones suggests that common triggering forces act in a broader area of West Bohemia/Vogtland.},

  abstract = {Seismic noise was recorded at 19 sites along a roughly linear array crossing the geothermal area at Ölkelduháls, SW Iceland. Noise in the frequency range between 3 and 7 Hz was identified as associated with the geothermal activity based on amplitude decay with distance and timing of energy in intra-station cross-correlation. This geothermal tremor is very stable in time, both in its amplitude and correlation relations. Differences of amplitude-spectral shape from one station to another and between the different components of motion at each station indicate a complex structure of the wave field, possibly due to a distributed source and scattering effects. The cross-correlation constrains horizontal group velocity weakly at about 1 km/s. Based on particle-motion diagrams and three-component polarization analyses the noise appears to be primarily composed of surface waves. The spatial decay of the noise away from the inferred source implies an elastic quality factor of Q ∼ 10 assuming the geometrical spreading of a surface wave in a laterally homogeneous Earth.},

  abstract = {The Kerlingar fault is a ∼30 km long fault located at the boundary between the Northern Volcanic Rift Zone, and the Tertiary Eastern Fjords Block in Iceland. The fault has a throw of 2–9 m down to the east and is most likely a normal fault. It probably ruptured in several earthquakes over extended time, but assuming it ruptured in one event it would have a magnitude of about $M_w$ = 6.7. The Kerlingar fault forms a sharp offset in a flat moraine, showing that the fault was active in the Holocene. Several characteristics of the fault are different from that of the presently active fissure swarms of the NVZ. It is unusually long, straight and continuous, and it is parallel with the boundary between the NVZ and EFB not perpendicular to the plate spreading. We consider three possible explanations for the existence of the fault. It may be formed in a rifting event, by stress transfer in relation to the Húsavík transform, or by a stress field caused by rapid crustal unloading during the last deglaciation. We favour the third explanation but note that the other two cannot be excluded. Differential movements at the NVZ–EFB boundary during deglaciations can occur as the two crustal blocks have different density, Young’s modulus, thickness, and subcrustal viscosity. They therefore respond differently to the unloading. This may explain why the fault is parallel with the NVZ–EFB boundary and not with the Holocene fissure swarms in the NVZ. Other faults at the NVZ–EFB boundary may be formed in a similar manner. Magma may have intruded some of them to form the distinct arcuate pattern of hyaloclastite ridges at the boundary between the NVZ and the EFB. Future model calculations could constrain better the effects this process has on the formation of faults.},

  abstract = {The South Iceland Seismic Zone is a transform zone marking the southern boundary of the Hreppar microplate. It is the source area of some of the most destructive earthquakes in Iceland’s history. The surface formations of the zone are ground moraines, alluvial plains and Postglacial lava flows, and show widespread evidence of Holocene faulting. The fractured area is 15 km wide and 70 km long. A project to map by GPS-instruments all recognizable Holocene fault structures in this zone is described here. A large majority of fractures strike NNE to NE and form left-stepping, en echelon arrays with a northerly trend. They are associated with right-lateral faulting at depth. Right-stepping arrays also exist, apparently associated with faulting onconjugate faults with ENE strike, but they are an order of magnitude less frequent and mostly of a secondary nature. Other fault trends also occur, but are rare. Push-up structures are prominent in association with the en echelon arrays, sometimes reaching heights of several meters. Fractures active during a few of the large, historical earthquakes in this region have been identified and traced, e.g. the 1630, 1784, 1896, and 1912 events. The fractures are found within narrow, N–S trending zones crossing the seismic zone. Thus the large-scale, left- lateral transform motion across the plate boundary is accommodated by right-lateral slip on a series of transverse faults arranged side by side within the zone and by slight rotation of the blocks between them, a process sometimes called "bookshelf tectonism".  Fractures formed during the earthquakes of June 17 and 21 ($M_w$ = 6.5) in 2000 and May 29 in 2008 ($M_w$ = 6.3) follow this pattern and confirm this general model of faulting along the transform zone. The size of push-up structures gives a clear indication of relative sizes of the earthquakes. The push-ups formed in 1630 and 1912 are an order of magnitude larger than the ones formed in the 2000 and 2008 earthquakes.},

  abstract = {Silicic rocks in Iceland are generally associated with central volcanoes and are often emplaced as domes on or around caldera rims. Some of these domes were formed subglacially while others were erupted under ice-free conditions. A gravity survey was carried out in the area of Krafla in 2007 and 2008 to determine the mean bulk densities of three silicic domes; essential data for meaningful modelling of the emplacement of cryptodomes and lava domes. Such data are scarce. Profiles were measured over three formations: Hlíðarfjall, made of rhyolite, 310 m high, 2 km long and formed under ice 90 000 years BP, Hrafntinnuhryggur, made of rhyolite, 80 m high, 2.5 km long and formed subglacially 24 000 years BP and Hraunbunga made of dacite, 125 m high and 1.8 km long, formed under ice-free conditions 10 000 years BP. Mean bulk density for each formation was obtained by the Nettleton method. Mean bulk density and volumes obtained were; Hlíðarfjall: 1600–1800 kg/m³, 0.143±0.014 km³; Hrafntinnuhryggur: 1575–1875 kg/m³, 0.021±0.002 km³; Hraunbunga: 1750–1775 kg/m³, 0.040±0.004 km³. The results show that all the domes have low densities, reflecting both low grain-density and high porosity. The density values are significantly lower than those of the surroundings, creating a density contrast possibly sufficient to drive the ascent of silicic magma. Furthermore, results from forward gravity modelling demonstrate that these formations are neither buried by younger volcanic eruptives nor are any roots detected. The domes studied were therefore emplaced by a dike to the surface.},

Einarsson especially on Pleistocene sequences in southwest and south Iceland. However, the stratigraphy of these sequences is often complex, and Einarsson’s mapping has only been followed up to a limited extent. The present detailed laboratory study on magnetic remanence directions in lava flows is focused on three locations within the above region. In two of these locations (in southwest Iceland), profiles spanning the boundary between the polarity zones named R2 and N2 by Einarsson were sampled. The potential of using this boundary for correlation over short distances was confirmed. In a third location (in south Iceland), three normal-polarity zones are present in a 500 m thick lava and sediment sequence of dominantly reverse polarity. The stability and within-lava agreement of primary remanence vectors is generally excellent. Remanence directions in successive lava units are in many cases very similar, indicating that the volcanism was episodic. In comparison to geomagnetic poles obtained in previous paleomagnetic collections of older lava series in Iceland, the poles derived from these and other Pleistocene lavas are rarely situated in low latitudes.},

  abstract = {The weathering and low-temperature alteration of basaltic glass was studied by geochemical modelling in order to gain an insight into the effects of temperature, acid supply and extent of reaction on the secondary mineralogy and water chemistry. Basaltic glass was dissolved in dilute water at 10–150°C in a closed system and secondary minerals commonly observed in nature allowed to precipitate when saturated. The weathering of basalts in the presence of CO$_2$ was observed to go through three stages; initially simple insoluble Al and Fe hydroxides were formed. Upon progressive basaltic glass dissolution imogolite, allophane and/or kaolinite and Ca–Mg–Fe smectites  predominated, decreasing the mobility of Al, Fe, Si, Ca and Mg whereas extensive weathering and alkaline pH values resulted in the formation of smectites, zeolites, calcite and SiO$_2$ minerals. Under low-temperature geothermal conditions and in strong H$_2$ SO$_4$ acid solutions (pH<4) amorphous silica, kaolinite, Al–Fe oxyhydroxides and sulphur-containing minerals were most important and most cations like Na, K, Ca and Mg were observed to be mobile. Under mildly acid conditions in CO$_2$ enriched waters (pH 5–7) kaolinite,  chalcedony,  Ca–Mg–Fe smectites and Mg–Fe–Ca carbonates predominated and Fe, Al and Si were found to be immobile, whereas Mg and Ca mobility depended on the mass of carbonate formed and water pH. Under alkaline conditions (pH>8) that resulted from a low acid supply and/or extensive basaltic glass dissolution chalcedony, celadonite, Ca–Mg–Fe smectites, zeolites and calcite were found to form, greatly reducing the mobility of most dissolved elements. The dominant factor determining the weathering and low-temperature alteration of basaltic glass and the associated elemental mobility is the pH of the water. In turn, the pH value is determined by the input and type of acid and their ionization constant and quantity of basaltic glass dissolution and secondary minerals formed that increases with the extent of the reaction and the temperature. The weathering mineralogy observed associated with basaltic glass in Iceland is typical of low to moderate degree of alteration under low (atmospheric) CO$_2$ conditions. The low-temperature regional geothermal alteration commonly observed in Iceland is also typical for low CO$_2$ alteration and the reaction order of celadonite and chalcedony, followed by mixed clays and chlorite and eventually zeolites and calcite, indicate increased water–rock interaction at pH>8 with temperature being less important on the overall reaction path.},

Ice-dammed lakes have also developed in the southernmost part of Skálabjörg and in Fossadalur. The highest and largest moraine ridge is situated 85–98 m above the contemporary glacier margin. Dating based on lichenometry, cartographic and photographic documentation indicates that the initial exposure of the highest moraine ridge occurred between AD 1896 and 1930 along its eastern margin and between AD 1915 and 1930 along its southwestern margin, giving an average glacier surface lowering rate of 0.8–1.3 m/yr in the southern hills of Skálabjörg. Hills above the highest moraine ridge bear imprints of earlier glaciation, most notably glacially abraded rock outcrops and transported boulders. Small active solifluction tongues and lobes with stone-armoured fronts cover the surface above the LIA limit. Small-scale and large-scale stripes exhibiting sorting down to c. 15 cm are abundant. The uppermost parts of the Skálabjörg nunatak are heavily frost-weathered bedrock outcrops, and can be classified as a typical periglacial domain.},
