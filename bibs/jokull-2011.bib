  abstract = {A high spatial resolution data set of gridded daily surface air temperature in Iceland has been derived for the period 1949–2010. Between 60–80\% of the daily estimates are within ±1°C depending on the month of the year and between 90–95\% are within ±2°C of independent station measurements in 1995–2010. The data set is thus well suited for various hydrological, glaciological and climatological modelling studies. The quality of the gridded data set is found to be best near the coast because of the higher station density. Including data from automatic stations, the establishment of which started in the early 90’s, was found to improve the data set. Derived 30-year mean monthly maps compare favourably with reference maps derived directly from monthly mean station temperatures with more sophisticated statistical techniques. An analysis of decadal temperature variations based on the data set shows that the decade 2001–2010 was the warmest of the last 60 years and makes it possible to identify spatial patterns in the decadal variations.  As an example, the spatial distribution of the warming of recent decades shows that it is more pronounced in the inland compared with coastal areas.},

  abstract = {The surface of the Snæfellsjökull ice cap in western Iceland was mapped with airborne LiDAR in 2008. A comparison with a DTM from 1999 derived by aerial photogrammetry shows that the surface of the ice cap has been lowered by 14.0 m on average during this nine year period, corresponding to an annual average mass loss of 1.25 m w.e. per year when a correction has been made for the different timing of the LiDAR survey and the aerial photographs. The area of the ice cap was reduced from 12.5 km² in 2002 to 10.0 km² in 2008. Based on meteorological observations at Stykkishólmur, ∼60 km to the east of the ice cap, the ice volume reduction indicates a mass balance sensitivity of −1.9 m w.e. a$^{−1}$ °C$^{−1}$ for the ice cap. This is within the range of sensitivities estimated for other ice caps and glaciers in Iceland in recent years. As the average ice thickness of Snæfellsjökull is only 30 m, most of the ice cap is likely to disappear within a few decades if the warm climate of Iceland in recent years persists. The LiDAR DTM has been successfully used to delineate the location of crevasses with an automated procedure based on the calculation of the local curvature of the ice surface.},

  abstract = {The depth of seismicity preceding the 2010 Fimmvörðuháls and Eyjafjallajökull eruptions in South Iceland has implications for the interpretation of the magma plumbing system that was active prior to those eruptions. Significant discrepancies exist in the hypocentral depths reported by different studies of the same earthquakes beneath Eyjafjallajökull in early-mid March 2010. Reported depths range from 3 km to 12 km. We use both real earthquake data and synthetic tests to show that the dominant factor controlling the best-fit hypocentral depths beneath the Eyjafjallajökull glacier is the network configuration. Hypocentral depths of 6–12 km are obtained when only data from permanent seismometer stations operated by the Icelandic Meteorological Office are used, the closest of which is located 13 km from the epicentral zone. Inclusion of data from six temporary seismometer stations deployed around Eyjafjallajökull, all within 4–15 km of the epicentral zone, constrains earthquake depths to be shallower than ∼6 km. A lack of proximal stations on top of the glacier limits resolution of earthquake sources that are shallower than ∼4 km, even when data from the six temporary stations are included. The choice of two plausible distinct velocity models has only a second-order effect on inferred hypocentral depths. We suggest that the true depth of seismicity is ∼2–6 km, which coincides with the depth of inflating magmatic intrusions inferred from surface deformation at that time.},

  abstract = {Surface sediments of different nature are common in Iceland. Natural soil sites and man-made fillings commonly serve as foundations for different types of structures. In Civil engineering work it is fundamental to know the geotechnical properties of these materials in the upper 20–30 m. A seismic method called Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) has been used in recent decades in Iceland to measure and evaluate shear wave velocity at different natural sites as well as in man-made fillings. The method is fast and involves low cost equipment. It gives reliable results down to 20 m depth by using sledge as a seismic source and copes with both soft and stiff soil sites. Furthermore, the technique can be applied at coarse grained gravelly sites where it can be difficult to use borehole and penetration methods. We describe the methodology used in these projects and review all SASW measurements carried out in Iceland. The soil strata at all test sites are classified based on sieve analysis when possible. Natural sites and man-made fillings are kept separated. A database and an open web site are introduced where all the SASW results can be viewed and shear wave profiles for different soil types and unlike sites can be compared. The main aim with the database and the webpage is to give scientists and engineers access to this data and enable them to compare stiffness at different sites.},

  abstract = {Tectonic activity within the Tjörnes Fracture Zone is characterized by strike-slip and extensional movements within three tranform zones, the Húsavík-Flatey Fault System, the Grímsey Volcanic Zone, connecting the offshore Kolbeinsey Ridge with the Northern Volcanic Zone on land, and the Dalvík lineament. We mapped the Þeistareykir volcanic system at the northwestern margin of the Northern Volcanic Zone using multibeam bathymetric maps, aerial photographs and satellite images. The 70–80 km long and 7–8 km wide Þeistareykir fissure swarm consists of large normal faults with maximum displacements of 200–300 meters along its western rim and rift fissures further east. A marked change in rift direction across the Húsavík-Flatey Fault System reflects complex tectonics at the junction of a transform fault system and a divergent volcanic zone.  Normal faults on land and offshore have an average azimuth close to N25°E whereas the average azimuth of rift fissures changes from ∼N22°E south of the Húsavík–Flatey Fault System to ∼N43°E, in western Kelduhverfi. The 1618 and 1885 AD rifting events within the Þeistareykir fissure swarm were most likely fed by lateral magma propagation from the Þeistareykir volcanic center, northwards to the western part of Kelduhverfi. Although limited, historical reports indicate that the January 1885 rifting event triggered a ∼$M$ 6.3 earthquake near Lake Víkingavatn. The 1885 rifting event in western Kelduhverfi was similar to the 1975–1976 rifting event in eastern Kelduhverfi, when a laterally propagating dike from the Krafla caldera triggered the $M_S$ 6.4 Kópasker earthquake on January 13th, 1976. Seismic sequences within the Húsavík–Flatey Fault System and the Þeistareykir fissure swarm in 1867–1868 and 1884–1885 indicate a tectonic relationship between the rift zone and the transform zone.},
