  abstract = {The year 2012 marks the centenary of the birth of the late Sigurður Þórarinsson, the first professor of geology at the University of Iceland. His legacy is widely recognized in the international geoscientific community and the highest award of the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth’s Interior (IAVCEI), the Thorarinsson Medal, is awarded to scientists for outstanding contributions to volcanology. Sigurður’s influence on Icelandic geoscientists was immense both through his university teaching and scientific collaborations. Although his research spanned a broad range of geosciences, including e.g. physical geography, geomorphology, periglacial features, and studies of interglacial sediments and tectonic earthquakes, his main fields of research were glaciology and volcanology in a broad context. Sigurður was president of the Iceland Glaciological Society from 1969 till his death, leader of most of its annual expeditions to Vatnajökull from 1953, and co-editor and frequent contributor to its scientific journal Jökull. This special issue of Jökull is dedicated to Sigurður’s contribution to geosciences and long-lasting influence on research in glaciology and volcanology in Iceland. This special issue contains an overview of Sigurður Þórarinsson’s life and scientific career by Sigurður Steinþórsson, ten peer-reviewed papers on different aspects of glaciology, glacial geomorphology and volcanology, Sigurður’s principal research fields and three society documentaries by two of Sigurður’s travel companions.},

Being a precocious child he was enrolled in the Akureyri Gymnasium from which he matriculated in 1931. Influenced by his natural-science teacher Pálmi Hannesson, he entered the Copenhagen University the following fall to study geology. After one winter in Denmark, however, he transferred to Stockholm to continue his studies, now in geography and botany as well as geology. After receiving his doctoral degree at the University of Stockholm in 1944, he returned to Iceland and worked for a while with the Research Council. In January 1947 he became Director of the Department of Geology and Geography, Museum of Natural History in Reykjavik, a position he held until 1968 when he became Professor of Geology and Geography at the University of Iceland. While Director of the Natural History Museum he was twice appointed Professor and  Director of the Geographical Institute of Stockholm, in the years 1950–1951 and 1953},

  abstract = {Tephra is the ideal volcanic product for the study of eruption history of Icelandic volcanoes and the underlying magmatic processes. In the last 11 centuries, 2/3 of all eruptions have been explosive, leaving tephra as their only product. Including eruptions of both lava and tephra increases the ratio of tephra producing eruptions to 3/4. Tephra conservation depends on several factors such as eruption intensity, weather conditions and volume of tephra produced as well as the surface on which the tephra is deposited. Vegetation improves conditions for in situ preservation of tephra layers, and once embedded in soil they can be preserved for long periods of time. Holocene eruption history can be reconstructed over the last 6–8 millennia from soil section and further back in time from lacustrine and marine sediment records. Tephra can be used to understand volcanic behaviour over long or short periods, a single eruption mechanism or individual production phases of an eruption. Examples of combined application of chemical analyses and tephra mapping show how (1) tephra layers from the Katla volcano unravel most of its Holocene eruption history and suggest likely increased eruption frequency in the future, (2) a fundamental link between repose time and eruption magnitude is manifested by Hekla tephra, (3) tephra from the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption gives insight into rapidly changing magmatic processes taking place during a single eruption, and (4) variability within tephra grains from the Grímsvötn 2011 eruption reflect different depth of magma storage. These examples illustrate how tephra studies, sensu lato, can reveal magmatic and eruption processes at different temporal and spatial scales that are of relevance for assessment of future eruptive scenarios},

  abstract = {This paper reflects on the application of tephrochronology in geomorphology. A common use of tephra layers is to define isochrons and use them to date environmental records. Applications of tephrochronology with the greatest practical utility, however, involve both classic isochrons (layers with an extensive distribution, distinctive well-characterised properties and good independent dating) and all other tephras present, including poorly-identified, unprovenanced and re-mobilised units that define time transgressive horizons. The effective use of this ‘total tephrochronology’ requires replication across multiple sites, the clear identification of primary tephra deposits and re-mobilised deposits,  combined with a good understanding of when tephra deposits truly define isochrons. Large scale replication of tephra stratigraphy is possible (and desirable) with terrestrial sequences, and can offer a detailed understanding of both geomorphological processes and human interactions with the environment. It is possible to use sequences of unprovenanced tephras as a ‘barcode’ to undertake local correlations and refine the application of well-known marker horizons to environmental records. High frequency and high resolution measurement of both the units between tephra layers and the tephra layers themselves can identify subtle shifts in landscape stability and land use.},

  abstract = {Currently the Late-glacial and Holocene marine tephrochronology on the shelf around Iceland comprises 130 tephra layers from 30 sediment cores ranging in age from 15,000 years cal. BP to AD 1947. A vast majority of the cores and tephra layers are from the North Iceland shelf. Much fewer tephra layers have been found on the South and West Iceland shelf. The early Holocene Saksunarvatn ash and Vedde Ash are the only tephra layers identified on all investigated shelf areas. For the last 15,000 years correlated tephra layers from the shelf sediments around Iceland to their terrestrial counterparts both in Iceland and overseas are 40 of which 26 are terrestrially dated tephra markers. Thirty correlations are within the last 7050 years. The terrestrially dated tephra markers found on the shelf have been used to constrain past environmental variability in the region, as well as marine reservoir age. The marine tephra stratigraphy on the North Iceland shelf has revealed variations in volcanic activity in Iceland further back in time than terrestrial records in Iceland. The numerous tephra layers identified in the sediments on the shelf demonstrate the potential of marine tephrochronology for dating purposes, land-sea correlation, marine reservoir estimations and reconstruction of past volcanic activity of Icelandic volcanoes.},

In his thesis in 1944 he outlined the prospect of finding ash from some of the major Icelandic eruptions in peat bogs in Scandinavia. Since Christer Persson’s pioneering work in the 1960s, more than 15 tephra horizons have been identified in distal peat and sediment sequences in Sweden. The most widespread tephra from the Last Glacial-Interglacial transition (LGIT, ca. 15–9 ka BP) is the rhyolitic phase of the Vedde Ash (ca. 12.1 ka BP) which has been found in several sites with lacustrine sediments and uplifted marine clays south of the Younger Dryas moraines. Two significant new additions to the LGIT tephrochronological frameworks of NW Europe are the Hässeldalen (ca. 11.3 ka BP) and Askja-S tephras (ca. 10.4 ka BP). The most significant mid to late Holocene isochrones in Sweden are Hekla-4 (ca. 4260 BP), Hekla-S/Kebister (ca. 3720 BP), Hekla-3 (ca. 3000 BP) and  Askja-1875. Other layers have been identified in single sites and are so far less valuable as marker horizons, but are potentially important for the future.},

The elevation range of Langjökull is 460–1440 m a.s.l. with a zero mass balance equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of 1000 m (southern outlets). The mass balance of the ice cap has been observed in situ every year since 1996–1997 and also assessed from estimation of glacier volume changes by comparing series of elevation maps from: 1937, 1945–1946, 1986, 1997 and 2004. The glacier margin of the Little Ice Age maximum (LIA; ∼1890) was estimated from the location of end moraines. The difference between the 1997–2004 annnual specific net balance estimated by volume change and in situ measurements is negligible (∼5 cm w.e.). During the two warm periods 1936–1946 and 1997–2009 the mean mass balance was similar; -1.6 and −1.3 m w.e. yr$^{−1}$, respectively. The colder climate during 1946–1986 and cooler yet in 1986–1997 resulted in specific mass balance close to zero; −0.3 and −0.2 m w.e. yr$^{−1}$, respectively.},

  abstract = {Kotárjökull is one of several outlet glaciers draining the ice-covered central volcano Öræfajökull in SE-Iceland. We estimate the average annual specific mass loss of the glacier, to be 0.22 m (water equivalent) over the post Little Ice Age period 1891–2011. The glacial recession corresponds to an areal decrease of 2.7 km² (20\%) and a volume loss of 0.4 km³ (30\%). A surface lowering of 180 m is observed near the snout decreasing to negligible amounts above 1700 m elevation. This minimal surface lowering at high altitudes is supported by a comparison of the elevation of trigonometrical points on Öræfajökull’s plateau from the Danish General Staff map of 1904 and a recent LiDAR-based digital elevation model. Our estimates are derived from a) three pairs of photographs from 1891 and 2011, b) geomorphological field evidence delineating the maximum glacier extent at the end of the Little Ice Age, and c) the high-resolution digital elevation model from 2010–2011. The historical photographs of Frederick W.W. Howell from 1891 were taken at the end of the Little Ice Age in Iceland, thus providing a reference of the maximum glacier extent.},

Several sets of moraine ridges reflect past ice front positions and river-cut sedimentary sections provide information about past environments. Here, we describe sediments and landforms deposited during the late Holocene. Chronology is obtained by $^{14}$C dating and cosmogenic exposure dating. The age determinations suggest that Sólheimajökull had major advances in the late Holocene prior to the Little Ice Age, and more restricted advances during the Little Ice Age, after AD 1539. Oscillations of the Sólheimajökull ice margin between 1938 and 2010 are documented by aerial photographs. Digital elevation models were produced from selected years in order to quantify ice thickness changes at the glacier margin over the last 50 years. The glacier margin thickened 70–100 m from 1960 to 1996 and then thinned 120–150 m between 1996 and 2010. In 2010, the glacier snout was 20–40 m thinner than in 1960. Additionally, the DEM time-series detect areas of erosion and deposition in the forefield.},

  abstract = {The ice covered active Öræfajökull central volcano forms a mountain range extending south from the central Vatnajökull ice cap, SE-Iceland. The high elevation span (7–2110 m a.s.l.) and extreme precipitation of this coastal part of Vatnajökull results in large mass turnover and high dynamic activity. Here we present bedrock and surface digital elevation models (DEMs) of Öræfajökull ice cap and its many outlets. The bedrock DEM is derived from radio echo sounding profiles and point measurements carried out in 1991–2012, and the surface from airborne LiDAR surveys in 2010–2011. At the centre of Öræfajökull is a ~14 km² caldera containing 4.3 km³ of ice, reaching ice thickness of 540 m. Most of the caldera drains meltwater eastwards to Kvíá river while the rest drains mainly westwards to Virkisá river. The caldera floor of Öræfajökull is smooth and volcanic mounds and ridges appear almost absent. An exception is a small topographic mound, beneath ~400 m of ice, near the water divides between Kvíá and Virkisá. The bedrock topography also suggests a separate caldera collapse, ~6 km² and ~150 m deep, within the main caldera. The subglacial topography implies an older highly eroded caldera north of the Öræfajökull summit (Hvannadalshnúkur 2110 m a.s.l.), similar in size to the present main caldera. The outlets of Öræfajökull, currently in some places up to 550 m thick, have excavated troughs reaching as far as 220 m below current sea level. Based on estimates of the present sediment transport rate in the rivers draining Öræfajökull, and the volume of the troughs, it would take over ~4000 years to form these troughs. Hence, it is unlikely that they were all excavated during the Little Ice Age. Marginal lakes will continue to grow and new ones form in the troughs as the outlets retreat in the coming decades, assuming current climate conditions or climate warming. The distribution of ice volume and area with elevation is however quite different from one outlet to another, suggesting variable glacier response to changing climatic conditions. A persistent temperature rise of 0.5–1.0°C may cause the lowest outlets to disappear completely, while the outlets with accumulation areas high up at the Öræfajökull caldera will survive even the warmest predicted climate scenarios.},

  abstract = {The geomorphology and sedimentology of the Teigarjökull and Búrfellsjökull, two small surge-type cirque glaciers at the Tröllaskagi peninsula, northern Iceland was explored for improved understanding of their surge imprints. Geomorphological, geological and remote sensing data on sediments and landforms were used for developing a geomorphological model for surge-type cirque glaciers in Iceland. Most surge moraines identified are in the form of uneven small ridges or debris sheets that constitute a boulder-rich hummocky terrain. The size and structures of two moraines in front of Teigarjökull are interpreted as suggesting that the glacier has in the past switched between surge and non-surge behavior. Hummocky surfaces, small medial moraines and crevasse-fill ridges are common, as are landforms suggesting dead-ice melting, such as backslumping, extension cracks and sinkholes. The surface sediments are rich in subangular and angular pebbles, cobbles, and boulders. This distinct geomorphology of the glacier forefields results from ample supply of coarse and angular sediments originating from the steep mountain slopes bordering the glaciers and subsequently carried to the marginal zone via englacial and supraglacial transport.},

The end moraine ridge is a morphological expression of a marginal sedimentary wedge formed during the last days of the surge. The actual end-moraine ridge was formed on the last day of the 1890 surge when the glacier became coupled to the bed and ploughed into the reverse slope of the marginal sediment wedge. Ductile deformation, favoured by high porewater pressure, dominated the construction of the end moraine while brittle deformation was induced when porewater pressure decreased, particularly at the end of the surge. Thus, the deformation was polyphase, developing from open folding to multiple overfolding when porewater pressure was high and finally to overthrusting, faulting and shearing at the very end of the surge when porewater pressure dropped severely upon porewater blow-out in front of the moraine. This structural continuum is exhibited by the four cross-sections. The glaciotectonic stress was absorbed within a relatively narrow zone due to high friction along a basal décollement. A new model illustrates the structural evolution of a fine-grained, fold-dominated end moraine and may serve as an analogue to similar end moraines in modern and Pleistocene environments.},
