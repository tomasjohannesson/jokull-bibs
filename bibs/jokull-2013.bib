  abstract = {Prominent  geophysical anomalies of several km extent were noted in the vicinity of the farm Stardalur in southwestern Iceland in a gravity survey published in 1954, as well as in a 1968 total-field aeromagnetic survey published in 1970, and a seismic refraction study of the crust published in 1971. Further low-altitude and ground magnetic surveys were conducted around Stardalur in 1969–1973, and an exploratory hole was drilled to 200 m depth in 1969–1970 at the site of a very distinct peak in the ground anomaly. Various studies were carried out on a core (to 143 m depth) and on cuttings recovered by the drilling. From 41 m depth down, this material consisted of altered olivine tholeiite lava flows, with a mean remanent magnetization intensity of the order of 15 times the average for Icelandic Tertiary lavas. Modelling of the anomaly peak, which was found to reach at least 27μT above the main geomagnetic field intensity of 52μT, indicated that the lava flows formed a body of dimensions about 200 by 600 m striking NE to NNE, inside a caldera structure. This structure probably dates from a normal-polarity subchron around 2 m.y. ago during the Matuyama geomagnetic chron. Further studies on samples from the Stardalur drill core revealed the presence of quite pure and slightly cation-deficient magnetite, whose percentage in the lavas is more than twice the average for Tertiary basalts in Iceland. The magnetite has largely been formed by exsolution from titanomagnetite, but it is also present in small grains which have separated from olivine. A very minor proportion of the magnetite may be of single-domain size, and it appears not to be a decisive factor in the bulk magnetic properties of the lavas. For instance, the natural remanence is much less resistant to alternating-field demagnetization than could be expected for single-domain grains. It is not certain whether it is a primary thermal remanence or of secondary origin, although the former seems more plausible.  In agreement with the conclusions of previous researchers, it appears likely that the strong magnetization is due to a chance combination of circumstances (such as high magnetite content, high oxidation state, and strong ambient field) rather than to some unique phenomenon. In this paper, a new ground magnetic survey at Stardalur is presented, along with a simple model of the source of the main anomaly peak. The geological reasons for the creation of that source remain unknown, but comparisons are made with a magnetic anomaly at Hvanneyri in western Iceland which has similarities with the Stardalur anomaly.},

  abstract = {he volcanic system of Tungnafellsjökull lies in the Central Iceland volcanic zone near the center of the hot spot and the triple junction where the Eurasian Plate, the North-American Plate and the Hreppar Microplate meet. Holcene activity in the Tungnafellsjökull system has been very low, only two small lavas are associated with the system. The Tungnafellsjökull fissure swarm is rather short and wide compared with fissure swarms of other volcanic systems at the divergent plate boundary, 40 km long and 20 km wide. Earthquakes are not common, with usually fewer than 10 being registered per year. Due to these facts, it came as a surprise when InSAR measurements detected movements on faults in the fissure swarm of Tungnafellsjökull during the Gjálp eruption in Vatnajökull in 1996 at a distance of around 37 km from the eruption site. Ground check in 2009 and 2010 revealed evidence of recent movements on faults in the area in the form of fresh sinkholes and fractures, some of which had moved as recently as the spring of 2010. Fresh sinkholes are known to form mostly during faulting events. They are formed when surface soil is washed into underlying, widening cracks in the bedrock. Based on earthquake data and InSAR images these fault movements occurred during three tectonic events, in October 1996 during the Gjálp eruption, in August 2008 and in November 2009. The events are expressed by increased seismicity in the Tungnafellsjökull area, both in terms of number of recorded earthquakes as well as rate of seismic moment release. The earthquakes were all small. The total released seismic moment is equivalent to that of a single earthquake of magnitude 3.4.The widespread evidence of recent fault movements and the small magnitude of the earthquakes suggests that the fault activity is related to magma movements rather than tectonic faulting.},

  abstract = {The interplay of volcanism and erosion in the Svínafell massif, on the western slope of the Öræfajökull volcanic center, SE-Iceland, is traced with geological mapping, magnetostratigraphy and $^{40}$Ar–$^{39}$Ar age determinations. The volcanic strata are mainly of Quaternary age, i.e., geomagnetic chrons of lower Matuyama to upper Brunhes. The 1832 m thick sequence in Svínafell is composed of 37 discrete lithologic formations, assigned to seven volcano-stratigraphic groups beginning with the onset of volcanism in the Öræfajökull stratovolcano during lower Brunhes magnetic chron (C1n < 781 ka). A regional basin formed shortly before the initiation of volcanism, generating a depocenter for the plant-fossil bearing Svínafell sediments between 0.70 and 1.78 Ma. The Svínafell volcanic strata accumulated during a minimum of eight glacial and inter-glacial stages. We document the Svínafell erosion history and landscape evolution, including 12 erosion surfaces. Erosion has led to extended stratigraphic hiatuses and removal of thick volcanic sequences.},

  abstract = {he surface deterioration of glacially abraded basaltic boulders by Fláajökull, SE-Iceland, deposited since the Little Ice Age maximum, was assessed based on measurements of micro-roughness, weathering rind thickness and Schmidt hammer R-values in order to find indices of relative age of the moraines. Micro-roughness of boulders was analysed using a Handysurf E35-B electronic profilometer working with a vertical resolution of 0.01 μm, which is a new method in geomorphology. A pilot microscopic analysis showed heavy fracturing within the weathering rind developed in fine-grained basalts, which is interpreted as inherited from mechanical weathering and responsible for deterioration of rock surfaces. A weak to moderate correlation was observed between time-dependent moraine rank and studied indices. Surprisingly, no chemical alteration was observed in analysed rock samples subject to weathering for more than a century. Results indicate that 80 years of weathering cause gradual increase in selected micro-roughness parameters, weathering rind thickness and decrease in Schmidt hammer rebound value. However, these indices of surface deterioration do not change on older moraines, which is attributed to exfoliation. The results do not provide unequivocal arguments in the ongoing discussion about the timing of the LIA maximum of Fláajökull, but encourage further use of the Handysurf E35-B electronic profilometer as a tool in determining initial stages of rock surface weathering.},

  abstract = {Variations in 22 hydrological variables were considered for 8 watersheds in Iceland to analyse the quantitative impact of variations in climate on hydrology during the period 1971–2006.  Observed streamflow characteristics were examined together with information about rain/snow fraction,  snow storage, snow and glacier melting derived from gridded precipitation and temperature data using a simple temperature-index melt model. The effect of the observed temperature and precipitation variations was examined by comparing subsets of the data containing the 25\% coldest and warmest and the 25\% wettest and driest years of each series. The seasonality of streamflow of all catchments and timing of hydrological events were found to be sensitive to differences of 1.1–1.4 °C in the annual temperature between the warm and cold data subsets. Snow storage was smaller and depleted earlier and the onset of spring snowmelt was shifted several weeks earlier in warm years, while glacial melt volumes increased by 20–40\%. These changes caused greater discharge in winter and spring and less discharge in summer, except for glacierized catchments where summer flow was maintained by glacier melt. Annual precipitation was 40–58\% greater in the wet compared with the dry data subsets, resulting in substantial seasonal and annual increases of rain, snow storage and snowmelt, streamflow volumes and flood occurrence rate. The seasonal distribution and timing of hydrological events were, however, usually not systematically different. Snow storage and glaciers are found to exert a strong influence on streamflow in Icelandic river catchments, making them sensitive to climate variations. The nature of the hydrological response is not spatially uniform but depends on location, altitude distribution and catchment type.},

  abstract = {The Mýrdalsjökull ice cap at the south coast of Iceland receives precipitation from the frequently passing extratropical lows, making the region the wettest in Iceland. Most of the ice cap’s accumulation area is a gently sloping plateau (1350–1510 m a.s.l.) within the caldera rim of Katla central volcano, feeding large outlets to the north and east. The oldest mass balance survey data are from 1944 and 1955. Here, mass balance measurements on the plateau, carried out 2001 and annually since 2007, are described and analyzed. Additionally, the winter mass balance is compared with precipitation estimates based on synoptic observations of precipitation at sea level and from high-resolution numerical simulations made with an atmospheric model. The measured specific winter balance at four locations above the equilibrium line was in the range 3.4–7.8 m w.e. (water equivalent) with a maximum winter snow thickness in excess of 12 m.  The summer mass balance was highly variable (–0.9 – –3.1 m w.e.) and the annual mass balance at the plateau had a high spatial and temporal variability (2.1–5.9 m w.e.). A comparison between measured winter balance and observations of precipitation at sea level, suggests that the plateau of Mýrdalsjökull receives on average 1–1.8 m w.e. of precipitation during summer. Results from the atmospheric simulations compare well with the measured winter balance and the estimated summer precipitation at the survey sites. The winter balance as well as the precipitation are among the highest reported in Iceland, and parts of the ice cap may annually receive up to 10 m w.e. of precipitation.},

  abstract = {The Snæfellsnes peninsula in western Iceland is characterized by Pleistocene volcanism dominated by alkalic magmatism across an extinct (>6 Ma) axial rift zone of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Although Iceland has an extensive seismic coverage, no systematic seismic monitoring is in place on the Snæfellsnes peninsula. In this paper, we present results of a three months field campaign in the Snæfellsnes peninsula and show for the first time that the region is (micro) seismically active in the depth range of 8–15 km. We identified and located a total of 29 seismic events that occurred in close proximity of the Snæfellsjökull volcano, with most events clustering beneath the volcano in swarm sequences. We propose that seismicity is associated with fluid-induced fracturing related to one or more magmatic reservoir(s), which may be elucidated in future seismic campaigns. Our observations are the first step towards the understanding of the plumbing system of the Snæfellsjökull volcano.},
