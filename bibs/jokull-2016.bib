  abstract = {Systematic mapping of the bedrock beneath the Icelandic ice caps began in 1980. We continue this effort by presenting a detailed bedrock digital elevation model (DEM) of Drangajökull ice cap in NW-Iceland, surveyed using radio echo sounding (RES) in March 2014. About 590 km of RES profiles, generally with 200–300 m spacing, were surveyed. This is to date the densest set of RES profiles measured on an Icelandic ice cap. We describe the processing of the radar profiles and construction of the bedrock DEM. We also analyse possible errors of surveyed glacier thickness along the profiles and discuss the accuracy of the final bedrock DEM. The bedrock DEM reveals topography with the same general character as other areas of NW-Iceland (Vestfirðir). The new bedrock DEM and a series of surface DEMs allow estimates of total ice cap volume and relative volume change since the mid-20th century. The bedrock data combined with the most accurate available surface DEM of Drangajökull, from July 2011, reveals a total ice cap volume of 15.4±0.4 km³, of which ∼71\% was stored on the west side of the ice cap. At that time the average thickness of Drangajökull was 107±3 m and the maximum observed thickness, found on Kaldalónsjökull outlet glacier, was 284±14 m. In 1946–2014, the total ice cap volume (in autumn) was reduced from ∼18 km³ to ∼15 km³. Approximately half of this volume was lost in 1994–2011. We describe and discuss several interesting phenomena revealed by the RES data and the derived bedrock DEM. The presented bedrock data also helps to explain curious surface features in the accumulation area of NE-Drangajökull.},

  abstract = {Many surge-type glaciers remain unrecognised because surge events can be short-lived and are rarely captured by satellite or field data. This study reports the first documented surge of Kverkjökull, central Iceland, adding a relatively short, narrow, steep and alpine outlet glacier from the Vatnajökull ice cap to the surge-type glaciers in Iceland. The surge occurred after decades of persistent and recently accelerated terminus retreat. The surge initiated after 2008 and immediately preceded drainage of the Gengissig geothermal lake and a jökulhlaup in 2013. The surge was still in progress in 2013. It caused vertical surface displacements of up to 20 m that were most prominent in parts of the glacier >100 m thick. The magnitude of surface elevation changes, terminus advance and ice surface velocity changes probably reflect a single surge phase. Asymmetry in the response of the glacier terminus to the surge front suggests interaction with near-stagnant ice in a part of the glacier terminus but otherwise the trigger and mechanism of the Kverkjökull surge remain unexplained.},

This is the first time that this type of study has been conducted in the marginal zone of Tungnaárjökull. Landforms identified included preserved shorelines, small wave-cut platforms, fossil deltas and a kame terrace, all associated with ice-dammed lakes. Lake, delta and kame depositional environments were interpreted on the basis of sedimentological analysis. Ice-dammed lakes developed in the northern part of the forefield as a result of Tungnaárjökull damming the outflow of meltwater between its snout and the Jökulgrindur volcanic ridge. Based on historical maps and aerial photographs the damming of meltwater was probably associated with the 1945 surge.},

  abstract = {Grain size and shape analyses were performed on silicic to intermediate Katla tephra (SILK) formed 2800–8100 years ago to examine whether the grain characteristics had changed with time, and in such a case, could they reflect changes in the eruption environment and/or changes in chemical composition. No systematic changes with time were observed in the grain shape parameters (elongation, ruggedness and circularity), however, the second oldest tephra layer SILK-A11 does not have the typical elongated grain shape that characterizes the other SILK tephra layers. Chemical analyses indicate that the SILK layers can be divided into three subgroups but no correlation between chemical composition and the grain parameters is observed. Changes in grain size of the SILK tephra layers with time indicate an apparent increase in grain size occurring about 6000 years ago, where largest grains are of category -3 Φ compared to 0 Φ in the older layers, all sampled at similar distance from source. This change in grain size could result from variation in ice thickness in the Katla caldera, with finer grain size between 6000–8200 years ago being due to thicker ice cover and greater availability of meltwater for magma fragmentation. Conversely, the younger coarser grained SILK layers may have formed under a thinner ice cover. A shift of the eruption sites to an area with thinner ice is also a possibility. However, no radical changes in the eruption environment 2800–8100 years ago are demonstrated by variations in grain characteristics, a conclusion further supported by large jökulhlaups from Mýrdalsjökull ice cap during this period},

  abstract = {Detailed records of past geomagnetic polarity transitions and excursions are seldom found in extrusive volcanics. One type of such events seems to involve very irregular variations of the magnetic field direction. Several examples of that type have been discovered in paleomagnetic surveys on the Neogene lava pile of Iceland. Lava sequences spanning the most notable event are accessible in the two tributary fjords Mjóifjörður and Ísafjörður south of Ísafjarðardjúp, Northwest Iceland. Paleofield direction results from about 80 sampling sites in these sequences have been described in previous publications. The present paper adds 20 sampled sites in Ísafjörður, extending the area where parts of this „Kleifakot instability event“ of the geomagnetic field are recorded, to 5–6 kilometers along the fjord. Intermediate paleofield directions in the collection often agree closely with each other in correlated strata, even more than 4 kilometers apart. Events like this can provide valuable correlation tools for future stratigraphic mapping and various studies on volcanological features in the relatively uncharted region around Ísafjarðardjúp and beyond. Globally, recognition of the existence of such events will aid in the interpretation of results in other kinds of paleomagnetic studies. The role of geomagnetic paleo-intensity determinations is discussed briefly in this context.},

The more rapidly flowing easternmost branch (Norðlingalægðarjökull) descends along a trench, reaching 200–300 m beneath sea level, and calves into the Jökulsárlón lagoon. Recently the rate of calving has increased and a depression has formed in the glacier surface. Hence, inflow of ice toward the eastern branch has led to a lateral shift of the Esjufjallarönd medial moraine bending it eastward by up to 900 m, during the period 2006 to 2016. Thus, the moraine has been shifted by ice flow into the lagoon.},
