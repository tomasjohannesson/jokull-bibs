  abstract = {A peculiar cluster of seismicity near the tip of Sandfellsjökull on the eastern flank of Katla volcano in southern Iceland has been analyzed in detail using data from a temporary seismic network. A total of 300 events were detected between July 2011 and August 2013, most of them from a swarm between December 4th and 12th, 2011. The sparser permanent network detected a small fraction of these events, but also a larger swarm in November 2010. When seismic activity started in this area is uncertain because of changes in the detection capability of the network over time. The events are of low magnitude (–0.5 < $M_L$ < 0.5) and the b-value of their magnitude distribution is high (1.6±0.1). Based on their frequency content (4–25 Hz) and clear P and S arrivals, the events are classified as volcano–tectonic. Two multiplets probably with different source mechanism are identified in their population. The events locate at approximately 3.5 km depth. Most of them are tightly clustered according to double difference relative locations in a volume that is only about 400 m in diameter in all directions. Several events are scattered up to 800 m beneath this volume. There is some suggestion of elongate structure in the cluster with a NNE/SSW strike and a dip of 60 degrees. We argue that these events cannot be due to a glacial or a broad tectonic process. Possibly, a localized source of fluid pressure, e.g., a small magma body at depth may be the source of these events.},

  abstract = {Because of extensive volcanic production in Iceland during the Holocene, many of the early postglacial large-volume fissure lavas cannot be unambiguously traced to their eruptive craters solely by observations in the field. For example, the Bárðarbunga volcanic system has been suggested as a likely source of the large Holocene lava flows found in Bárðardalur valley, but this idea mainly relies on petrographic observations. We conducted a chemical and isotopic study of the lavas in Bárðardalur. For comparative purposes, we also targeted basement rocks of the Bárðarbunga central volcano, as well as several eruptive units in the region north of Vatnajökull. Based on a comparison of chemical and radiogenic isotope data of lavas from the Bárðardalur region and the eruptive units north of Vatnajökull and the Bárðarbunga central volcano, it appears most likely that the lavas of Bárðardalur valley belong to the Bárðarbunga volcanic system. These new data, and a compiled dataset for other selected volcanic systems of the NRZ, shed light on possible limitations when assigning erupted material to its source volcano by means of chemical composition. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that our understanding of the relative importance of the different processes at play during the petrogenesis of Icelandic basalts is likely to be greatly improved by multi-parameter datasets for geologically well-characterized eruptive units.},

  abstract = {Aeromagnetic surveys of the Reykjanes peninsula in Southwest Iceland were carried out in 1965 and 1968. They revealed the presence of positive magnetic anomalies in the southern and central parts of the peninsula, whereas a broad negative anomaly followed its northern coast. These variations were caused only to a small extent by the local topography. A map of SW-NE trending fissure swarms in the peninsula, published in 1978, indicated that they were correlated with the positive anomalies as well as with centers of recent volcanism and high-temperature geothermal activity. Processing of the results from the 1968 survey combined with further surveys in 1973, 1985–1986 and 1991–1992 has resulted in a new multicolor map of field residuals in the Reykjanes peninsula and its surroundings. The most prominent feature in the map is lineations of positive anomalies partially overlapping with the volcanic fissure swarms. Susceptibility measurements on drill cuttings indicate that their sources may reach to more than 1.5 km depth.},
